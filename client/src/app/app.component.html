<h1>{{title}}</h1>

<ul>
    <!-- These properties in angular are case sensitive. 
        Though you have defined your entity as 'UserName' in API, angular gets the response with the property as 'userName' in camel case -->
        <!-- Here ngFor is a structural directive and 'let user of users' is an expression -->
<li *ngFor = 'let user of users'>{{user.id}} - {{user.userName}}</li>
